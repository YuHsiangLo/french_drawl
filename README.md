## About WEBLING - Web Linguistics Audio Recorder

WEBLING is a web application designed to facilitate linguistics research projects. It takes the user through a wizard that explains the project and conducts a survey to collect data from the user. The user is then brought to a final page where they read and can record text. Their responses and recording are saved onto the server.

WEBLING is developed using the Laravel framework on PHP.
