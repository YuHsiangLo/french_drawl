<strong>Welcome, and thank you for your interest in the @lang('messages.IndexTitle') project!</strong>

<br><br>Do you think there are different accents in British Columbia? If you live in or are from British Columbia, you are invited to participate in an online study that looks at what people think about the varieties of English spoken in BC. This study is being conducted by Dr. Amanda Cardoso (Lecturer, UBC Linguistics)  and Dr. Molly Babel (UBC Linguistics). If you decide to participate in this study, you will be asked to answer a few brief questions about yourself, and then record yourself reading a short passage in English. The passage will take roughly 3-4 minutes to read aloud.
